# Pipeline Builder Application

This project is a pipeline builder application built using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and ReactFlow. The application allows users to create, connect, and manage nodes representing sources and destinations in a visually interactive manner.

## Features

- **Add Nodes:** Users can add two types of nodes: Source nodes on the left and Destination nodes on the right.
- **Connect Nodes:** Users can connect Source nodes to Destination nodes by dragging from one node to another.
- **Connection Restrictions:** The application restricts connections such that two Source nodes or two Destination nodes cannot be connected to each other.
- **Delete Connections:** Users can click on a connection between two nodes to delete the connection.
- **Draggable Nodes:** Nodes can be dragged and repositioned anywhere on the screen.
- **Randomized Node Positioning:** New nodes are added at random Y-coordinates for varied placement.
- **Modular Code:** The code is organized into reusable components to ensure maintainability and scalability.
- **Standard Folder Structure:** The project follows a standard folder structure, enhancing clarity and organization.
